Pixel hunter game

There are two arrays with 10 pixels. 

The first array (row) is the array with the pixel which the neural network can move. 

The second array (row) is the array with the pixel that the user (or randomly the code) can change to a new goal.

The neural network should find out that it gets the most reward if it directly jumps to the pixel without any intermediate steps. 

If it uses intermediate steps , it only gets a friction of the reward.


TIP: To not increase the code, simpler is better, use a magnifier tool like e.g. KMag to see the game in a bigger size.
